# PerfectFit

It is a mobile fitness assistance application based on Flutter + ML Kit/MediaPipe. 

It uses the mobile phone camera to perceive the environment, and uses the human body key point recognition technology to compare and analyze the user's current posture with the movements in the standard demonstration video, and give feedback in the form of scores. 

Through this system, users can exercise independently at home, and the system plays the role of "AI coach", prompting irregular movements in real time and guiding users to improve.
